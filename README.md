# ðŸŽ“ Object-Oriented Programming & Information Systems â€“ E-Portfolio

This e-portfolio was developed as part of my MSc Computer Science coursework and showcases both academic and practical engagement with core object-oriented programming principles. It includes selected work completed throughout the course, such as system designs, hands-on Python artefacts, and a final project that demonstrates full-cycle development â€” from initial UML design to implementation and testing.
