        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Assignment: System Design for Humanoid Robot Operations</h4>
        <p>This assignment involved the design of a Python-based object-oriented system to simulate a humanoid robot. It included UML diagrams (class, activity, sequence, state), and the use of stacks, queues, and lists for simulation logic.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Helped me develop system-level thinking and understand how to translate requirements into design components.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Assignment: Implementation of the Humanoid Robot System</h4>
        <p>This implementation translated the system design into working Python code. It included a modular robot class, a CLI in <code>main.py</code>, and a test suite in <code>test_robot.py</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Strengthened my understanding of modularity, CLI design, and test-driven development. It was a rewarding end-to-end development challenge.</p>

        <p>The final project was a Python simulation system for a humanoid robot. Its modular structure enabled realistic command execution and feedback through a CLI. I used unit testing and separation of concerns to ensure quality and maintainability.</p>
        <p>Challenges included time constraints and simplifying some originally planned features. However, I gained deep insight into planning, coding, and testing in real-world-style projects.</p>

    <!-- Technical Reflection Note -->
    <!--
      REFLECTIVE NOTE:
      During the development of my e-portfolio, I encountered a technical challenge while trying to structure and place
      a new artefact within the portfolio layout. Despite several attempts, the formatting and placement kept causing issues,
      and I had to decide whether to keep pushing for a fix or take another approach.

      This became a valuable moment of reflection. Instead of seeing it as a failure, I recognised it as a reminder that
      technical work often involves knowing when to adapt. I learned to evaluate the effort-to-impact ratio and chose
      to reflect on the experience instead of forcing a solution that added little overall value.

      It reminded me that in real-world development, not every issue needs to be solved immediately â€” sometimes it's better
      to document it, learn from it, and move forward with clarity and focus.
