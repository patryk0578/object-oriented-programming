  <!-- Assignment 1: System Design -->
  <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow mb-6">
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Assignment: System Design for Humanoid Robot Operations</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This assignment required a formal system design for a humanoid robot capable of executing three core operations:
      Navigation, Object Manipulation, and Human Interaction. The design included UML diagrams (Class, Activity, Sequence,
      and State Transition) and demonstrated the use of data structures (list, stack, queue) to simulate environmental interactions.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Reflection:</strong> This task deepened my understanding of designing scalable, maintainable systems.
      Using UML forced me to visualise component responsibilities and interactions before implementation,
      which ultimately helped streamline the later stages of development.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Assignment 2: Implementation -->
  <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow mb-6">
    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Assignment: Implementation of the Humanoid Robot System</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Building on the design from Assignment 1, this Python implementation included a command-line interface (`main.py`),
      modular logic (`robot.py`), and unit tests (`test_robot.py`). The robot class handled basic commands like start,
      stop, move, and interact with users and its environment. It simulated command stacking, battery level, and internal state.
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded overflow-x-auto text-sm mb-4">
<code>class HumanoidRobot:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.active = False
        self.battery = 100

    def start(self):
        if not self.active:
            self.active = True
            return f"{self.name} is now active."
        return f"{self.name} is already active."

    def charge(self):
        self.battery = 100
        return "Battery fully charged."

robot = HumanoidRobot("HAL-9000")
print(robot.start())
print(robot.charge())</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Reflection:</strong> This final build tested everything I’d learned in the module — from object-oriented structure
      and CLI design to code documentation and unit testing. It reinforced the importance of clean architecture and flexible code.

<!-- Final Project Evaluation Section -->
<section id="evaluation">
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Final Project Evaluation</h3>
  <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
    <p class="mb-4">
      The final project brought together all the elements explored throughout the module. I developed a modular Python system
      simulating a humanoid robot that could respond to commands via a command-line interface. The project included error handling,
      runtime state management, and a strong focus on usability and maintainability.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I applied design patterns, abstraction principles, and OOP concepts like encapsulation and polymorphism. The modular structure
      made testing and debugging significantly easier, and my implementation of unit tests ensured robust code.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      One challenge was balancing complexity with deliverability. Some advanced features had to be scaled back, such as real-time
      command logging and automated environment simulation. Still, this provided a valuable lesson in prioritising features and
      understanding project scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this project helped me build confidence in designing, implementing, and evaluating software systems from scratch.
      It was the most rewarding part of the module and reinforced the value of thoughtful architecture and clean coding practices.

<!-- Reflection Comment on Technical Hiccup -->
<!--
  REFLECTIVE NOTE:
  At one point, I attempted to automate artefact insertion into this portfolio layout but encountered HTML structure issues
  that disrupted the presentation. Rather than continue forcing a solution, I chose to pause, reflect, and revise my approach.
  This became a key moment of learning: not every obstacle is best solved head-on. Sometimes clarity comes from stepping back
  and reevaluating the goal. This moment helped me grow both technically and professionally.
